= Control Flow Structures

== Choice

=== ``if``-``else`` statement

Syntax:

  if cond stmt1 else stmt2

=== __select__ statement

== Iteration

=== `loop` statement

Syntax:

  loop {
    stmt1;
    stmt2;
    ...
  }

Semantics:

The statements in the body are executed in an infinite loop.

=== `break` and `continue` statements

Syntax:

  break;

  continue;

Semantics:

Relative to the scope of the smallest loop that contains either of them,
a `break` statement jumps to the first instruction after and
a `continue` statement returns to the first instruction.
The presence of either not inside a loop constitutes a malformed program.

=== `while` statement

Syntax:

  while cond {
    stmt1;
    stmt2;
    ...
  }

Semantics:

The statements in the body are executed until the expression `cond`
evaluates to `false`.
The above may be deemed as syntactic sugar for the following:

  loop {
    if !cond {
      break;
    }
    stmt1;
    stmt2;
    ...
  }
