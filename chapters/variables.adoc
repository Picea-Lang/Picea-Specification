= Variables

A *variable* is a relation between a symbol and a non-__unit__ value.
A *value* is either _unit_ (cf. _void_ in C-like languages) or some information
stored on memory.
A *symbol* or *identifier* is an ASCII alphabetical value followed by a
possibly empty sequence of ASCII values which are either alphanumeric or
underscore.
A variable may be declared without an initializer expression, but its value may
not be read before assignment.

.Syntax
```
# uninitialized variable +
DataType <identifier>; +
# initialized variable +
DataType <identifier> = ...; +
```
